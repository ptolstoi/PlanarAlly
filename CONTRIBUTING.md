# Development Info

PlanarAlly consists of a client and a server component. If you want to run a development setup you'll need to install both components.

**Note:** This is only necessary if you want to make changes to the actual codebase. To simply use PA, follow the install instructions in the docs (the url can be found in the readme).

## Git usage

This project uses the gitflow branching strategy. This means that the master branch is intended for releases only. All pull requests should be done on the development branch.

When making a pull request, make sure the code is formatted properly.

For the server you can run `black .` in the server folder,
for the client you can run `npm run lint` in the client folder.

## Server

All code of the server is located in the `server` folder at the root level of the git repository.
The server infrastructure runs on aiohttp, a python async webframework.
Install python >=3.6 (a virtual environment is recommended) and install all the dependencies.

### Example install

Lines 2 and 3 are optional. Replace `python` with `python3` if the default is not py3.

```
cd server
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Change the server.cfg file to what you wish to use and you can start the webserver with a simple

`python planarserver.py`

The above command will start the server in production mode. This expects build js artifacts to be created and available to the server. (These can be created by building a production version of the client).
To use the server together with a development version of the client instead use:

`python planarserver.py dev`

If both server and client are running you can launch PA by visiting http://localhost:8000

It is strongly recommended to also install the devdependencies ('requirements-dev.txt) as this contains the formatter that is used for PA.

## Client

The client is written in typescript, editing the javascript file directly is strongly discouraged and any pull request that only changes the js file will also be declined.

To get the client side up and running you'll need to install the dependencies with

`npm i`

To build a production version use:

`npm run build`

To build a development version use:

`npm run serve`

### Target version

As mentioned in the client and server steps, there's a difference between the development version and the production version. Make sure that you use the same target for both environments when building.

### The result

To actually view and interact with the result whether you use the development or the production version you simply need to browse to your localhost at port 8000 (by default).

# Translation

PlanarAlly is currently using [vue-18n](https://github.com/kazupon/vue-i18n) to implement internationalization. Thus, we'll need to translate `LOCALE.json`, and put it into `client/src/locales` to enable the language selection.

**Note:** Installing the client component is only necessary if you want to generate an i18n report and check missing keys or unused translations.

## Adding a new language

The most convenient way is to copy `en.json` and rename it to the locale you want to contribute, such as `zh.json` for Chinese, `ja.json` for Japanese.

And then you'll need to check the new file and translate it into the language by replacing the English value while keeping the key:

```js
{
    ...
    "common": {
        "server_ver_prefix": "Server version:"
    }
    ...
    --> after translation -->
    "common": {
        "server_ver_prefix": "サーバーのバージョン："
    }
}
```

## Changing UI and adding keys

If you contribute to the codebase and change UI by adding strings, modifying existing strings, etc., you may need to make it i18n safe.

### Adding keys

There are two kinds of method to call i18n translation: `$t("key")` and `v-t="'key'"`.

`$t()` is an extended method for Vue

```
# To use it in html block:

<p>{{ $t("dir.sub_dir.file.key") }}</p>

# To use it in code block:

this.$t("dir.sub_dir.file.another_key").toString()
```

`v-t` is only used as directives, and it will replace the `textContent`, but provide a better performance in general.

`<p v-t="'dir.file.pa_key'"></p>`

### Finding missing keys

PlanarAlly integrates [vue-i18n-plugin](https://github.com/intlify/vue-i18n-extensions) to provide i18n report.

To get missing keys and unused translations:

`npm run i18n:report`

To get the output file of the report:

`npm run i18n:report -- --output 'path/to/output.json'`

### Naming conventions of keys

PlanarAlly is using named formatting, and the keys are case-sensitive. The translation files are structured as below:

```json
{
    "common": {
        "server_ver_prefix": "..."
    },
    "game": {
        "ui": {
            "floors": {
                "new_name": "..."
            }
        }
    }
}
```

`Common` is for the common strings across all Vue files, and for other strings, please follow the rule:

`$Dir$_$Subdir$..._$File$_$key$_$ARGS$...`

To provide the JSON above, the two keys would be:

`common.server_ver_prefix`

and

`game.ui.floors.new_name`

You can also read [vue-i18n documents](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n) for more details.
